# Flutter Gradients

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanMonga/flutter_gradients/master/images/header.jpg" align="center" alt="Header" height="500" width="100%"/>

A curated collection of awesome gradients made in Dart (port of [https://webgradients.com](https://webgradients.com) for Flutter). Only linear gradients included for now.

## Installation

Add the Package

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_gradients: ^1.0.0+3
```

# Usage

### Import the package

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gradients/flutter_gradients.dart';
```

## How To Use

### For LinearGradient

By default `FlutterGradient` will generates the `LinearGradient`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanMonga/flutter_gradients/master/images/angel_care_linear_gradient.png" align = "right" height = "180" alt="Exemple">

```dart
   GradientType type: GradientType.linear;
```

```dart
    Container(
        width: 150,
        height: 150,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
            gradient: FlutterGradient.warmFlame(),
        ),
    );
```

or

```dart
    Container(
        width: 150,
        height: 150,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
            gradient: FlutterGradient.warmFlame(type: GradientType.linear),
        ),
    );
```

### For RadialGradient

You can customize the follows values :

- center : The center of the gradient, as an offset into the (-1.0, -1.0) x (1.0, 1.0) square describing the gradient which will be mapped onto the paint box.
- radius : The radius of the gradient, as a fraction of the shortest side of the paint box.
- tileMode : How this gradient should tile the plane beyond the outer ring at `radius` pixels from the `center`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanMonga/flutter_gradients/master/images/angel_care_radial_gradient.png" align = "right" height = "180" alt="Exemple">

```dart
   GradientType type: GradientType.radial;
```

```dart
    Container(
        width: 150,
        height: 150,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
            gradient: FlutterGradient.warmFlame(
                type: GradientType.radial,
                center: Alignment.center,
                radius: 0.5,
                tileMode: TileMode.clamp,
           ),
        ),
    );
```

### For SweepGradient

You can customize the follows values :

- center : The center of the gradient, as an offset into the (-1.0, -1.0) x (1.0, 1.0) square describing the gradient which will be mapped onto the paint box.
- startAngle : The angle in radians at which stop 0.0 of the gradient is placed.
- endAngle : The angle in radians at which stop 1.0 of the gradient is placed.
- tileMode : How this gradient should tile the plane beyond the outer ring at `radius` pixels from the `center`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanMonga/flutter_gradients/master/images/angel_care_sweep_gradient.png" align = "right" height = "180" alt="Exemple">

```dart
   GradientType type: GradientType.sweep;
```

```dart
    Container(
        width: 150,
        height: 150,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
            shape: BoxShape.circle,
            gradient: FlutterGradient.warmFlame(
                type: GradientType.sweep,
                center: Alignment.center,
                startAngle: 0.0,
                endAngle: math.pi * 2,
                tileMode: TileMode.clamp,
            ),
        ),
    );
```
